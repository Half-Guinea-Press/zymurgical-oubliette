Spell Description:<br>
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, except that any damage dealt by the attack is lightning damage instead of its normal type. Additionally, an arc of lightning jumps to a creature you choose within 5 feet of the target, dealing 1d6 lightning damage.<br>This spell’s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an additional 1d8 lightning damage and secondary damage deals an additional 1d6 lightning damage to their targets. Both damage rolls increase by one die at 11th level (2d8 and 3d6), and 17th level (3d8 and 4d6).
