Spell Description:<br>
Lighting a candle, you speak dark curses in a lost tongue, directed at one creature you can see within range. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for the duration. While cursed, the creature takes psychic damage once per turn equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier whenever it attacks or casts a spell. If the target doesnâ€™t attack or cast a spell on its turn, it can repeat their saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success.<br>A remove curse spell ends this curse early.

At Higher Levels:<br>
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, you deal an additional 1d8 psychic damage for each slot level above 1st.
