Spell Description:<br>
This spell teleports a creature to your location. Choose a creature known to you within range as the target of this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Charisma saving throw to resist this effect. The target is placed at a location of your choice within 30 feet of you. You choose if the target is sitting, standing, prone, or bound with nearby restraints. At the end of the spell's duration, you can choose whether the target remains at your location or is teleported back to the location from which it was abducted.
