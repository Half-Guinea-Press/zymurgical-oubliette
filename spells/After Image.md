Spell Description:<br>
You create an illusory duplicate of yourself which follows your every movement. When you are hit by an attack during the spellâ€™s duration, roll any die. On an odd roll, the attack targets and hits the duplicate instead of you. The duplicate vanishes, reappearing after you move 10 feet or more or take the Dodge action. On an even roll, the attack targets you as normal.
