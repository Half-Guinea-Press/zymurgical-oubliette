Spell Description:<br>
An invisible 40-foot radius field of magic extends from you, disrupting bullets and causing firearms to malfunction. Within the sphere, attacks with firearms fail, and firearms used to make an attack immediately jam. A jammed firearm can't be used to make an attack until a creature uses its action to clear the weapon malfunction<br>Firearms outside the sphere which are fired into it have disadvantage on attack rolls and deal only half damage on a successful hit.
