# When the world was just an idea...

This is a thought experiment of sorts. Or better put an experiment in documenting my work towards designing, building, and ultimately using a world as a campaign setting for a table top role playing game(ttrpg). While I have worldbuilt multiple times throughout my life, I am not sure if I ever tried documenting it like this in a blog format with the intent to use that as a baseline to create a usable campaign setting for a ttrpg. So this will be interesting to say the least. Let's see how far I can get...

I have started with brainstorming some ideas, questions, and problems that I want to approach in this worldbuilding. Here they are in no order other than how they came to me:

- A world at war? Something between the Great War and the Thirty Years war?
- Mic the fantasy/magic with more modern warfare of matchlock/wheellock, indirect fire, and larger scale warfare
- Technology advancing do to an industrial revolution
- Possible Napoleanic Wars type warfare but with magic alongside the muskets?
- How would magic look during that era?
- Flintlock Fantasy?
- Timeline built on sets of requirements that trigger off screen action that has consequences
- How to balance technology vs magic vs warfare?
- How to balance large scale war magic vs personnal magic?
- How to balance resources vs replenishing times per day?
- Where does magic come from?
- What are spell slots? What is their purpose?
- What classes are actually necessary? Thematically relevent or important?
- Core Activity? Core Mechanics?
- Why are guns shunned as too powerful when spell scrolls would enable fireball every round for as many scroll you have?
- Consumable resource vs renewable resources for player characters?
- What prevents PC from creating consumable magical items in bulk?
- What traditional rules are broken? breakable?
- How should armor work?
- Steam Punk? Magic Punk?
- Why would technology/science evolve if magic exists and is readily available?
- What technology/magic would evolve or be developed?
- What would war be like with magic?
- How would gods factor into the world? demigods? celestials or demons or fiends?
- How would a multi-verse effect the world?
- How would powers and/or dominions effect the world?

There is one conceit hiding in those questions unfortunately. I am currently using DND 5e as a baseline ttrpg to start with when it comes to the game mechanics for this setting. This may be scrapped for a different system if it turns out not to fit well.
