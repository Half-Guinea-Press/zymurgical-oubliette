-   ## Beckon Familiar

    You can cast the find familiar spell as an action without expending a spell slot or spell components. Once you cast this spell in this manner, you can’t do so again for 1 minute.You must have the Familiar feature to choose this hex.

-   ## Duplicity

    ---

    As an action, you can create an illusory duplicate self, composed of shadowstuff, to confuse your enemies. When a creature attacks you, roll any die. On an odd number, the attack strikes the duplicate and misses, regardless of its roll, and the hex ends. On an even roll, the attack targets you as normal. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.

    As an action, choose one creature you can see that can see you within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn
    
-   ## Obfuscate

    As an action, you create a 20-foot radius sphere of fog centered on yourself. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

-   ## Remedy

    At 3rd level, you learn a hex which closes wounds and eases pain. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. This creature regains a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your witch level. A creature which regains hit points from this hex can’t be affected by it again until it finishes a short or long rest.

-   ## Ruin
