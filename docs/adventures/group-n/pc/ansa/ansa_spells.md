On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.

On a failed save, a target is cursed for the duration. If only one target is cursed by this spell, you can use your action or bonus action on a subsequent turn to choose another target within 30 feet of the cursed creature to make a saving throw. While two creatures are cursed by this spell, they are unable to willingly move further away from each other. A remove curse spell ends this curse early.

On a hit, the target takes 1d8 piercing damage as a spectral meat hook plunges into their body. Before the beginning of your next turn, if the target attempts to move more than 30 feet away from you, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be prevented from moving farther away until the beginning of your next turn. This effect ends and the meat hook disappears at the beginning of your next turn, or if you are further than 30 feet away from the target.

    Duration: 30 days

    You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.<br>
    You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.<br>
    You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.

    The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.<br>
    This spell can’t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.

    Range: 30 feet<br>
    Components: V, S<br>
    Duration: 1 minute

    A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.<br>
    You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.<br>

    ---

    3rd-level abjuration<br>

    Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

    -   The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
    -   The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
    -   Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.
    When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

    ---

    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.

    Components: V, S<br>
    Duration: Instantaneous

    ---

    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

-   ## Message

    ---

    Transmutation cantrip<br>
    Casting Time: 1 action<br>
    Range: 120 feet<br>
    Components: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)<br>
    Duration: 1 round

    You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.<br>
    You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

-   ## MINOR LIFESTEAL

    ---

    Necromancy cantrip<br>
    Casting Time: 1 action<br>
    Range: 60 feet<br>
    Components: S<br>
    Duration: Instantaneous

    You drain life energy from a hostile creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 necrotic damage. You then gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt, which lasts until you finish a long rest. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

    At Higher Levels. This spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4)

-   ## Polymorph

    ---

    4th-level transmutation<br>
    Casting Time: 1 action<br>
    Range: 60 feet<br>
    Components: V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)<br>
    Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

    This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.<br>
    The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.<br>
    The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.<br>
    The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.<br>
    The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

-   ## Prestidigitation

    ---

    Transmutation cantrip<br>
    Casting Time: 1 action<br>
    Range: 10 feet<br>
    Components: V, S<br>
    Duration: Up to 1 hour

    This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

    -   You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
    -   You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
    -   You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
    -   You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
    -   You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
    -   You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

    If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.<br>
    
-   ## Produce flame

    ---

    Conjuration cantrip<br>
    Casting Time: 1 action<br>
    Range: Self<br>
    Components: V, S<br>
    Duration: 10 minutes

    A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.<br>
    You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

    ---

    At Higher Levels. This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

-   ## Raise dead

    ---

    5th-level necromancy<br>
    Casting Time: 1 hour<br>
    Range: Touch<br>
    Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)<br>
    Duration: Instantaneous

    You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.<br>
    This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead creature to life.<br>
    This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.<br>
    Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

-   ## Ray of sickness

    ---

    1st-level necromancy<br>
    Casting Time: 1 action<br>
    Range: 60 feet<br>
    Components: V, S<br>
    Duration: Instantaneous

    A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.

    ---

    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

-   ## Remove Curse

    3rd-level abjuration<br>
    Casting Time: 1 action<br>
    Range: Touch<br>
    Components: V, S<br>
    Duration: Instantaneous

    At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner’s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

-   ## Revivify

    ---

    3rd-level necromancy<br>
    Casting Time: 1 action<br>
    Range: Touch<br>
    Components: V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes)<br>
    Duration: Instantaneous

    You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

    ---

    3rd-level transmutation<br>
    Casting Time: 1 action<br>
    Range: Touch<br>
    Components: V, S<br>
    Duration: Instantaneous

    You conjure a potent acid at your fingertips, which can corrode metal and burn flesh. Make a melee spell attack against a creature or object within your reach. On a hit, a creature takes 6d4 acid damage and, if it is wearing nonmagical metal armor or wielding a nonmagical metal shield, you can corrode either its armor or shield. Corroded armor takes a permanent and cumulative -3 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed. A corroded shield is destroyed. If you target a nonmagical metal object with this spell that isn’t being worn or carried, you corrode and destroy parts of the object you choose that can fit within a 1-foot cube.

    ---

    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 3rd. Additionally, you can destroy one additional cubic foot of a nonmagical object for each slot level above 3rd.

-   ## Scrying

    ---

    5th-level divination<br>
    Casting Time: 10 minutes<br>
    Range: Self<br>
    Components: V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)<br>
    Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

    You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

    Knowledge of Target

    | Knowledge | Save Modifier |
    | :- | :- |
    | Secondhand (you have heard of the target) | +5 |
    | Firsthand (you have met the target) | +0 |
    | Familiar (you know the target well) | -5 |

    Connection to Target

    | Connection | Save Modifier |
    | :- | :- |
    | Likeness or picture | -2 |
    | Possession or garment | -4 |
    | Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like | -10 |

    On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours.<br>
    On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.<br>
    Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.
