-   ## Hermit Discovery

    ---

    The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.

    Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.

-   ## Shadow Touched

    Your exposure to the Shadowfell's magic has changed you, granting you the following benefits:
    
    -   Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.
    -   You learn the invisibility spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the illusion or necromancy school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

    -   Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
    -   You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.
    -   Choose one skill in which you have proficiency. You gain expertise with that skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it. The skill you choose must be one that isn't already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your proficiency bonus..

    -   You learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll. Choose the cantrip from the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. Your spellcasting ability for this cantrip depends on the spell list you chose from: Charisma for bard, sorcerer, or warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.

-   ## Spell Casting

    ---

    Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells. Your magic originates deep within yourself, where your insidious curse stirs restlessly. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

-   ## Witch's Curse(Possessed)

    ---

    Your soul is occupied by a foreign spirit that sometimes tries to wrest away your consciousness. However, while you sleep, the spirit whispers magical secrets to you. You learn an additional witch spell at a level for which you have spell slots at 1st level, and again at 4th level, 8th level, and 12th level. These spells do not count against your total number of spells known.

-   ## Hexes

    ---

    You can learn a number of powerful incantations, known as hexes, derived from the same insidious magic which cursed you.

    At 1st level, you gain two hexes of your choice. Your hex options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain witch levels, you gain additional hexes of your choice, as shown in the Hexes Known column of the Witch table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the hexes you know and replace it with another hex.

    Unless otherwise stated, if a hex calls for an attack roll or saving throw, it uses your spell attack bonus or spell save DC. All hexes require verbal or somatic components (caster’s choice at the time of casting.)

    Unless otherwise noted, if a hex lasts for a duration, you concentrate on it as you would a spell. You can concentrate on a hex and a spell at the same time, and you make only one Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration on both.

-   ## Cackle

    ---

    At 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to cackle. The duration of your hex extends by 1 round for each creature affected within 60 feet of you.Not all witches laugh maniacally when they cackle, but all cackles require a verbal component, as a spell. These range from mundane curses and insults, to the murmuring of dead languages and speaking backwards.

-   ## Familiar

    ---

    At 2nd level, you learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual without material components. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. The spell is improved in the following ways:
    
    •   Your familiar takes its turn immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice).
    •   Once per turn as an action or a bonus action, you can mentally command your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack.
    •   When you cast a spell, you can deliver it through your familiar as if it had cast the spell, even if the spell doesn’t have a range of touch.
    •   When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: death snail*, flying book*, homunculus, mock*, moon jelly*, pet rock*, pseudodragon, rag doll*, sprite, tin soldier*, winter wolf pup*, and yarn golem*. The statistics for creatures marked with an asterisk are in Appendix C.

    As a witch, familiars you summon are imbued with your insidious magic, granting them the following benefits:
    
    •   Your familiar can use your spell attack bonus for its attack rolls.
    •   Your familiar adds your proficiency bonus to its Armor Class, saving throws, and damage rolls.
    •   You add twice your witch level to your familiar’s maximum hit points.

-   ## Witch's Craft(White Magic)

    ---

    Your knowledge of magic has culminated in learning a Craft, an innate variety of magic which exists apart from the schools of magic. When you reach 3rd level, choose one Witch’s Craft. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
    
    If your craft grants you a hex at any level, it doesn't count against your total number of hexes known.

-   ## Bonus Spells

    ---
    
    -   1st bless, cure wounds
    -   2nd lesser restoration, prayer of healing
    -   3rd beacon of hope, revivify
    -   4th death ward, guardian of faith
    -   5th mass cure wounds, raise dead

-   ## Hex(Remedy)

    ---

    At 3rd level, you learn a hex which closes wounds and eases pain. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. This creature regains a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your witch level. A creature which regains hit points from this hex can’t be affected by it again until it finishes a short or long rest.

-   ## Talisman of Protection

    ---

    At 6th level, you can craft a talisman which wards off harm. Creating a talisman takes one hour of work, which can be performed over the course of a short rest. You can only have one of these talismans at a time; crafting a new talisman causes the previous talisman to become mundane. Any creature that wears a talisman can add a d4 to all saving throws it makes.

-   ## Benevolent Surge

    ---

    At 10th level, when you, your familiar, or one of your allies you can see within 30 feet takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause that creature to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your Charisma modifier. Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.

-   ## Insidious Spell

    ---

    Starting at 5th level, when you cast a witch spell that affects a creature that is under the effect of your hex, that creature has disadvantage on its first saving throw against the spell. This feature only applies to a hostile creature which is the sole target of your hex.

-   ## Improved Familiar

    ---

    At 7th level, your familiar’s attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage resistance and immunity. Additionally, you can choose the following forms for your familiar: brass dragon wyrmling (without its breath weapon), fright*, grep*, imp, or quasit. The statistics for creatures marked with an asterisk are in Appendix C.

-   ## Dying Curse

    ---

    Beginning at 9th level, when a creature reduces you to 0 hit points but does not kill you outright, you can lay a nefarious curse upon them. The creature is cursed for up to 24 hours. While cursed, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. If you regain consciousness or the creature is targeted by the remove curse spell, the curse ends at the end of the creature’s next turn.Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
