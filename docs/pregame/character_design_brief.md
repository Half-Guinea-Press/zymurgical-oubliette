# Character Design Brief:

The world of Noksathr is one that is at apex of a hill. Behind it is a past of mystery, magic, unknowns, and myths. In front of it are multiple possible futures, all of which contain power struggles, secrets to be revealed, technology and magic to be unleashed, and a reballancing of power in ways that no one is truly ready for. 

## Character Stories

### Player Character Concepts:

Whether knowingly or unwittingly, your characters are sitting in a cart set to careen down this hill. There will be plenty of curves, drop offs, hazards, and ambushes along the way. What sorts will depend on the combination of steering, luck, and who you affiliate with. Based on the poll questions, this world is primed for war and other forms of upheaval. So character concepts that are ready to survive, exploit, or manage such things would work beautifuly. I fully expect the party to be a rogues gallery of unique individuals from various walks of life. I am actively working on developing the world as I am writing this. So if there is a specific aspect you would like in the world to help flesh your character out please let me know. And if there are any questions of the sort like "What is this world's equivilent to ...", please let me know. This is as much your world to create as mine. 

### Character Hooks:

Any good story relies on hooks to connect the various plots and people together. At Season 0 one of my plans is to work with all of you to ensure that your character's hook to the main plot of the campaign is dug in deep and both the player(you) and the storyteller(me) understand it. I also will be working with all of you to build hooks between your characters. I am uncertain how many people will ultimately be in our group as Nate is busy looking at potential players. But do expect to impromptu at least one or two story hooks between your character and another player. This could be past jobs they have worked, times where they have run into each other, common friends or enemies, or something that would help gel the two characters' relationship narratively. 

## Worldbuilding vs. Game Mechanics

### Bio-Diversity and Character Species:

If one looks, any number of different sentient and sapient species exist on this world. That being said, the distribution of this diversity varies place to place. There are pockets of concentration for all species so while human is the majority species of the planet currently, any large enough population center will have any number of other species. That being said here are the general population thoughts on the common PHB Core Races:

Human -  They are the common person. It all depends on their nationality, ethnicity, and wealth.
Elf - A rare sight outside of the gentry and nobility. They are an old race from long ago and they carry knowledge of magics long lost. Many of the old houses have ties if not blood relations with the elves.
Orc -  Crushed and scatter long ago due to wars and conflict. They are all refugees.
Halfling/Gnome - Many believe them either fey or elven children. Tricksters and vagabonds.
Dwarf -  Sealed up in their mountains. Shewd merchants and penny pinchers.
Tieflings -  Unholy and cannot be trusted. 
Shifters -  Wildmen that live on the edges of the scarred lands. More beast than man, the old magics must have twisted them.

Other common races of this world:

Aerugo -  Fragile like the moths they come from, these are even more rare than the elves. They tend to stay in their deep forests. They are mysterious and spiritual creatures that see more than the eyes should.

Bejuk - Travelers and Wanderers, they rarely leave their herds. Great for when you need a caravan but pacifists all of them. They chew their cud like cows rather than raise swords.

Gremlin - Mean spritied like things, you can find them where ever there is garbage or destruction. They can make anything out of the scraps of the greater species. But they don't trust anyone, and you can't trust them.

Ogreborne -  Bastards from the demon wars of the east. No better than Tiefling with worse tempers. 

Verdan -  Twisted and freakish things that one would think are cousins to the Gremlins if anything. But no two are alike. Mutations from some science experiment gone wrong or some wizard's cruel joke.

Stevedore -  Clockwork golems with their own thoughts. No one knows who made them, not even themselves. Started showing up in the ports a century ago. At first the ships thought the docks owned them and the docks thought the ships brought them. 

(I will be posting the Aerugo, Bejuk, Gremlin, Ogreborne, Verdan, and Stevedore soon. If there is one your like let me know and I will get that done first.)

### Classes and Professions:

The all class options that can be found in the WOTC published source books are available for use. The important difference in this world is where magic is within society. Pure arcane casters such as Bard, Sorceror, and Wizard are almost exclusively in the upper class. The nobility keep a strangle hold on who can learn magic in most countries. And those who don't outlaw magic use by non-royalty or gentry outright will instead conscript those who have magical ability into the military and make them magic-weilders for the crown. Artificers are slightly different as they tend to be from more scientific disciplines and thus are not seen as "real" wizards as their magic and magic related items only seem to work for them. Clerics are viewed as a mixture of clergy and wizards, their magic coming from a divine historical source without much of the direct religious beliefs more dogmatic rules.

Classes that can be found in the Valda's Spire of Secret are also allowed without problems. The classes are typically viewed as such:

Alchemist: Most science than Artificers, they are magical chemical engineers that use the arcane to further their understanding of the chemical and push that understanding to new limits.

Captain: Natural leaders and orators, these people tend to be from military service or noble birth. They always have a follower or two in their footsteps. 

Craftsman: Craftsman push industry and technology from the front, making new and exciting advances everyday. 

Gunslinger: While firearms are common in conventional military forces, these are a different breed. Their understanding of projectile warfare and the tools of their trade make them unique threats on the battlefield.

Investigator: The world is still full of mystery that hides in the shadows and cracks as everyone moves towards the future. These people hunt the secrets and bring light to the hidden.

Martyr: Unfortunate champions of forgotten or unheard gods. They have a path that they did not choose and an end that will change the world whether they want to or not.

Necromancer: Necromancy, the grim magic of death, is laden with forbidden secrets and unquestionably evil spells. Its practitioners, therefore, are a unique breed, possessing a well of dark energy to say nothing of their armies of undead thralls.

Warden: Tanks of the battlefield. They can defend the line against overwhelming forces and soak damage while their compatriots rain hell down.

Warmage -  More common than wizards, warmages focus on the simplest forms of magic turning what many consider nothing more than a party trick into devestating force on the battlefield. They are almost exclusively found in the military of their country.

Witch -  They come from the darker recesses of the past. Afflicted by a sinister curse, witches can spin dark magic into hexes, which they use to debilitate foes. They are also accompanied by their familiars, loyal magical companions which they use to deal the killing blow.

## Adventuring Equipment, Technology, and Magic Items

### The Elephant Gun in the room

First and foremost, firearms exist in this world. We will be used the proficiency chart on pg 295 of Valda's for what classes have what proficiencies. And the available firearms are upto the industrial age firearms in Valda's as well. Technology based weapons are more resource tracking intensive than their magical counterparts. So make sure you know that walking in and are paying attention to your inventory.
