# The Noksathr Campaign Brief:

Noksathr is a world precariously ballanced. The history books say that wars are won with power over the world itself more than swords. The first great kingdoms and empires first grew with the support of their deities whose favor they had garnered. Only to fall as those same gods in their fickleness chose others as their champions. This continued in a cruel cycle that turned the world over and over. Until, the races realized that the divine where only children playing with them as toys. And the god's powers were something that they could wrest from the divine to hold themselves. And the control of the world changed hands to those who learned and mastered the ways of the arcane. Spells replaced prayers as the deciding factor on the battlefield. But just like the divine, the arcane was found to be fickle. Few had the ability to harness the power innately. And those who could learn to master them were even fewer. The time and study it took to bring destruction and subjecation to the battlefield was irreplaceable. Thus the loss of someone who had such power could bring the mightiest low. Recent history has shown that anyone can wield enough power to do just that.

## The World of Noksathr

### Iliaster:

While magic had always existed, the powers of gods were something that was seen as out of reach. The forces of the universe were only able to be bent so far by the will of the mortal races. Those with longer lives may have found it easier by degrees, none were able to do more than small tricks when compared to the divine. All that changed with the discovery of Iliaster. Found in places where the boundary between worlds had grown thin, this illusive liquid metal is the stuff found between. It made even the smallest pressure on the rules and laws that held the forces of the universe static into the weight of gods. Bending them as if the most maleable thing. With enough the rules evaporated under the weight of augmented will. The world quickly ceased to be the divine's playthings as the rulers of man with their new found treasure weilded the same power and dominion. A treasure that it's very existance is guarded fanatically and controled lest they loose the source.

### The Nythr Gates:

Red flecked obsidian obelisks scattered accross the world were nothing more than the sign of a forgotten ancient empire until they awoke and lit up the sky. The ribbons of aether stretch in the sky directly above obelisk to obelisk like they pin the glowing paths to the surface of the world. First, they were used as markers for travel. Keeping their glow on in sight both over land but at sea meant you would always know where you were. But they were always near wild areas, no-man lands, ungoverned, unkempt, and full of nothing but death walking. An accident showed another purpose of their power. Now flying ships use the flows of aether to keep their ships afloat high above. Something that before would involve more power than was worth turned into something that could be accomplished for a pittance with a correctly built ship. 

### The Industrial Revolution:

As the world grew with each new discovery of another Nythr Gate, the world in turn began to realize that while magic made the lives of the nobles and the aristocrats luxurious and easy, the common man needed better ways of working and surviving. Technology relied on the mistakes and discoveries of all that came before rather than the amassed skills and knowledge that single individuals gathered as wizards did. This enabled the common man to begin to find better ways to accomplish everyday tasks. At first, these technological leaps were suppressed by those with power in order to keep the power ballance steeply tipped in their favor. But as time ground forward, inovations became harder to hold back. Once those in power saw how much more money, influence, and power they could amass if they simply controled the masses and their technology, did they let loose the chains holding technology back. The subsequent explosion of advancement has become known as the industrial revolution. The modern world began to see things that only magic could provide before being accessible by the common man. And there was no going back. 

### The Beramendi Wars:

Valtazar Beramendi was the son of a Urdine soldier and the daughter of a Koloc port master. He rose from basterd to a commander in the Urdine army with a mastery of strategy and tactics that was unrivaled by neighboring countries. He became the general master of the army after the sucessful conquest and crushing of the Nira forced in the battle of Sacre Torc where his use of riflemen as anti-wizard units not only won the battle but irradicated the top war wizards of the Nira army. This promotion and acknowledgement of the ability of non-magical warfare spurned him futher. Through a series of wars he blazed a trail through the whole of the continent, creating an expansive empire that stretched futher than any in modern history. It was only due to internal political intrigue and betrayals that his reign ended. Beramendi exiled to an unnamed island, the empire only lasted a decade longer before the taken lands were won back by the defeated countries. The royal houses, without their wizards, lost their political clout and fell to a rebellion that turned Nira into a republic. 

### Magic, Technology, and Alchemy:

While it is not a singular pilar of power as it was in its hay-day, magic is nearly everwhere in the world. Technology fills in the gaps where magic doesn't. But these two things are like oil and water. While they can mix if alot of work is put in, they inevitably separate if the stirring stops. And with mixtures of magic and technology that separation can lead to explosive results. This makes most combinations found either in small scale one offs or large scale expensive projects. Alchemy is one of the only places where the arcane and science find a middle point. Through alchemy the arcane has been used to better understand where the rules and laws of reality are and their natural bend points. This has enabled small scale uses that in the right hands can have devestating results. 

### Arsalan's Maw:

There is a rumor of a storm coming from the east. A storm with a gaping maw whose scream flays the flesh off the bone and the sanity out of the soul. Where it has traveled a scar can be found that has been burned into the earth itself. What is left is twisted and shattered. And from that scar comes more evil and hunger than can be satiated. 

## Factions and Patrons:

### The Sundered Legion: 

A mercenary company known to sell their services to any and all, even both sides of a battle. This has given them a reputation of killing any without remorse and holding to their contract like it is with the gods themselves. Once a unit of the legion is under contract they will follow it to the letter until completed and not a moment more. This has led to many to actually read their contract as to leave it unread often leads to misunderstandings and problematic endings.

### The Marquis of Carabas:

An enigmatic fellow to say the least. His entourage has been seen at many of the most famous parties, balls, and festivals in all the most important kingdoms and empires. Although it is unclear where the Marquis came to his wealth, it is known that it is expansive. His title one of respect rather than nobility, or at least that is the rumor. He owes his alleigances to no particular ruler. But where ever the sweet winds fill sails, his ships are always sailing the bountiful harbors. 

### The Gazateer of Ookriss Tess:

Ookriss Tess is a large Dirinion port town with one of the world's largest libraries. This library is known for its maps and its researchers that travel the world gathering details on locations. It is said that the master gazateer is so emense that one could if it would be bound into one volume then openning it would eclipse the sun until the top cover rested on the table. The vast wealth of the library helps keep this gazateer expanding. Where this wealth comes from is up for debate. But it is unwise to question people with so many books.
