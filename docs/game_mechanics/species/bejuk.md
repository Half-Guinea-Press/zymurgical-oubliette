# Bejuk

The sights (and scents) of bejuk caravans are not easilyignored. Horned and antlered humanoids with bestial eyesand ears ride atop fantastic animals, each decorated withtrinkets, dyes, and other adornments that celebrate bejukaesthetics. Once a caravan stops at a city to trade goods andinformation, young bejuks feed and clean the mounts whilethe adults handle transactions until they all quietly pack upand move on. They do not own land, nor do they wish to doso: their caravan holds all their needs and treasures.


=== "Info"

    **Silken Roads**
    
    Migration is a necessity for the bejuk. They seek to collect allbeautiful things that the world and its races have to offer.This goes for their beasts of burden as well, which they oftentreat better than themselves. It is common to see a bejuk'smount eating a more colorful meal than its rider. And whilebejuks can't digest meat, they are happy to hunt and provideit for their carnivorous and omnivorous friends. This is madeall the more impressive after seeing that bejuk caravans holdsome of the largest beasts in the known world. If necessary,bejuks will subsist on bark and grasses in order to feed them.
    
    **Bejuk Names**
    
    The nomadic bejuks take great care in naming their children.Many variables matter: the locations of celestial bodies at thetime of birth, the first animal to approach the newborn,where the umbilical cord was cut, etc. It is exceedingly rarefor a bejuk to be named on their parents' whim alone.Because family structures are loose and monogamy is rare,bejuk surnames match the name of the community they hailfrom. A two-letter "bridge" connects their given name to thissurname and expresses how long an individual has beenapart from their community. Therefore, an example of a fullbejuk name would be Itala sa Zerutz.
