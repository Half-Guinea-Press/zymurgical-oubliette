# Gremlins

A once proud race that migrated from their dangerous homelands, now wandering salvagers without a home of their own. The gremlins struggle to establish themselves in the world.

These small creatures are no strangers to war and strife. Despite the natural dangers posed by their original homelands, neighboring factions sort to claim their unique resources. Many assumed the gremlins would be wiped out in a few years, but their size and ingenuity proved the world wrong.

When nation fought nation on their scarred home, they would stay out of sight, surviving by making a habit of pil-fering the many battlefields for material and tools. But the wars would not last. In the end the violence culminated ina cataclysmic event that fully destroyed the gremlins home and forced them to flee - they have been nomads ever since, spread thin across the world.

Because of their history, gremlins keep themselves distant from other races. Many might find a gremlin to be distrustful and stand offish, never settling down in other places for long. Despite this the gremlins share a collective dream of one day having a home that they can call their own once more.

    **Invention from necessity**
    
    Because of their past of war and scavenging, many a gremlins ancestor was exposed to tools they were never meant to use, and grew into a habit of cobbling things not meant to fit together. A talent born from survival for combing and rearranging unlikely material into working tools and inventions. This history of improvisation quickly became a part of gremlin culture.
    
    These skills have been passed down and finely honed to an almost innate ability. For a gremlin makes due with the most humble of scraps to great effect. As such, salvaging what other people have deemed unusable has become a great strength, which gained them the unfortunate infamy of being seen as trash diggers and scroungers. Gremlins are often found in derelict sites or trash heaps filled with free material for them to work with.
    
    **A nose for magic**
    
    The ancient ancestors of the gremlins, distant cousins of the goblins, were curious beings but dull of the mind, barely above common fauna. However, the unique resources of their homelands were magically infused minerals occasionally revealed by the soil and tucked away in crevices. The proto gremlins sometimes came upon these ‘shiny rocks’and would attempt to consume them. This diet became oddily beneficial to the humble gremlin, and kick started an evolutionary change. They developed magic senses in their nose and taste buds, allowing them to reliably find more precious minerals. This ability to sense magic also helped them avoid magical threats that were innate to their homelands. Over time, the ancient gremlins evolved into the smart and innovative creatures they are today.
    
    Gremlins have never been strangers to the chaos but there are some of them that actively seek it. This can vary from harmless mischief to outright sabotage. Though their actions do not help their poor reputation, gremlins find their actions more thrill and fun seeking then bad, looking to relieve stress and enjoy the world in their own chaotic way. This does not mean their actions are always in jest however, as they are also more likely to seek retribution to those who wrong them, or remind them of the forces that ruined their homelands. Be it for good or evil, anarchy reigns.
    
    **Personality**
    
    The gremlins are not known to be very friendly with other races. Distrusting, standoffish, socially inept, if they are not traveling in groups with other gremlins, they stick to themselves as hermits. Even if several gremlins occupy the same community, they will often compete with each other for resources.
    
    It is hard to gain trust, but once the trust is formed with a gremlin it is an unbreakable lifelong bond. While they are not emotionally intelligent, their bonds are deep and genuine. But do not expect them to be vocally sentimental, actions mean more than words.
    
    **Physiology**
    
    The gremlin shares ancestry with the common goblin. But with the exception of their diminutive size and large ears, they have little in common. Gremlins are covered in short-thin fur, commonly blue-adjacent with green or purple hues in the spectrum. They have a prehensile thin long thin tail with a fur-tip, and large almost cat-like eyes.
    
    **Gremlin names**
    
    Gremlin names are short and snappy to keep them efficient. No one has time for a multi-syllable name. They also like using names based on tools or simple onomatopeyas.last names are not common as gremlins usually travel in small groups. But they might further identify themselves by group, which they commonly call ‘crews’.
    
    Female names: asch, brix, calli, dyna, effy, fuse, geema, harpyr, impa, joell, kindle, lokke, monkee, nails, ovah, ply, que, rosi, snips, tility, unnu, vel, wylda, xera, yeet, zinc

    -   Survival philiosophy. 
        
        Different schools of mind on how to make it are found among gremlins across the world. Each ofthese philosophies discribe how you as a gremlin carve out a path for yourself in this world. Choose one of the following; ingenuity, and trickery.
        
        === "Ingenuity" 
            
            You prefer to use your intelligence for problem solving, being convinced that the right idea is the key to any issue. Occasionally you show unrivaled moments of inventiveness and critical thinking capabilities thanks to your finely honed mind.

                When push comes to shove your mind works overtime to find a solution for your current predicament. When you fail an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can add your proficiency bonus to the result, which may cause the roll to become a success. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you have finished a short or long rest.
                
            -   Brilliant utilisation. 
                
                When using a tool you can make an intelligence check in place of another ability score for any task.
            
        === "Trickery"
            
            You have chosen a more anarchic approach to living by creating opportunities via the foolishness and downfall of others. Daring and bold, you usually target powerful forces for bigger rewards. There is little satisfaction or benefit in targeting the already downtrodden.
            
            -   Ability score increase. 
                
                Your dexterity score increases by 1.
                
            -   Cunning. 
                
                You are proficient in one of the following skills: acrobatics, desception, sleight of hand, stealth.
                
            -   Scram. 
                
                When you fail a dexterity (sleight of hand) check, a creature makes a successful wisdom (perception) check to detect you, or you fail a charisma (deception) check to deceive another creature, you can use a reaction to move up to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. To use this trait, you must see the creature when it detects you or sees through your deception.
                
            -   Throwing arm. 
                
                You are proficient with thrown improvised weapons and if the improvised weapon weighs 1 lb. Or less, you treat the weapon as if it has the finesse trait.
