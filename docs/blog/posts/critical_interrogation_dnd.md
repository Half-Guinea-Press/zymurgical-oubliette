# Critical interrogation of the broken mechanics in Dungeons and Dragons 5e

Why am I looking at Dungeons and Dragons? Why am I specifically looking for things that are broken? First off, I am looking to see what are its good things and bad things objectively. Secondly, I am looking to for broken things that may make it the wrong system for the world that I have in my head that I am building. And lastly, I am pondering over whether taking DND 5e as a starting point and building on its strengths while replacing mechancis that are its weaknesses would be enjoyable enough for me to put the time into it. Because if it could be fun, it might be worth it to go ahead and do it for just that reason alone.

Now of course I know that there are a lot of people who are putting out their own version of the D20 based fantasy system. This makes sense after the OGL tom-foolery. And it makes sense because people want to play and tell stories in the fantasy genre. What better to use as a jumping point than something that already has a lot of name recognition, a lot of already built content, and an already built customer base. Not to mention a customer base that isn't exactly happy due to the aforementioned tom-foolery. But if anything this make me even more interested in seeing what I can figure out.

Maybe I realize that there is a different game system that works better. Maybe I end up with my own version of D20. Either way I think I end up with a game system to play with. So it is win-win.

So here is what I have come up with so far:

- Social encounters
- Economy vs. treasure/loot accumulation
- Crafting things, mundane or magical or technological/alchemical
- Dominance of perception as a skill
- Stealth rules
- Resting, long and short
- Consumable vs renewable character resources
- CR and encounter system
- Leveling up
- Grappling
- Prone
- Action economy
- Attacks of oppurtunities
- Static damage of weapons but with multiple attacks vs evolving damage of spells as caster levels up or higher spell slots
- Concentration
- Attunement
- Stacking Bonuses
- Balance at upper levels
- Armor
- Static after roll initiative
- Lack of movement in combat
- No incentive for active defence
- Shields
- Spell DCs don't factor in spell level
- No skill ranks
- Bounded accuracy
- Alignment system
- No ability to make custom spells as character
- Unrealistic damage for weapons relative to each other and relative to skill level
- Magic system especially spells being self contained unique things
- Classes
- Encumberance
- Technology
- RAW vs Rule of Cool vs Inventive play
- Min/Max or optimial builds
- Inspiration/ Hero Points
- Material Components
- The myth of game balance
- Magic items not following spell logic, spell logic not being universal between spells
- No ranks in weapon skills
- No logic to the interdependence of certain abilities with certain ability scores
- Very little uses constitution
- Ability scores
- Variable amount of crunchiness, combat high, skills low, social low
- Multiclassing

By no means is this an exhaustive list. And some of these lack context that makes what I wrote make sense to anyone else but me. But it is a start. And I will work my way through the list in no particular order as time moves on.
