As you cast this spell, a spectral meat hook is flung at the creature of your choice, connected to a spectral chain. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 piercing damage as a spectral meat hook plunges into their body. Before the beginning of your next turn, if the target attempts to move more than 30 feet away from you, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be prevented from moving farther away until the beginning of your next turn. This effect ends and the meat hook disappears at the beginning of your next turn, or if you are further than 30 feet away from the target.
