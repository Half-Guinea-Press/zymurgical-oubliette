    Constructed Resilience. You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:

    - You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
    - You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.
    - You are immune to disease.
    - You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.

    Sentry's Rest. When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn't render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.

    Integrated Protection. Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor:

    - You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
    - You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor other than a shield, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this way.
    - While you live, the armor incorporated into your body can't be removed against your will.

    Specialized Design. You gain one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice.

    Feature: Still Standing

    You have weathered ruinous misfortune, and you possess hidden reserves others don't expect. You gain the Alert, Skilled, or Tough feat (your choice). Your choice of feat reflects how you've dealt with the terrible loss that changed your life forever. If you've kept your senses sharp for every opportunity and climbed your way out of misery by seizing the tiniest scrap of hope, choose Alert. If you've redoubled your efforts to reclaim what was once yours, choose Skilled. If you've stoically persevered through your misfortune, select Tough.

    Gunner

    You have a quick hand and keen eye when employing firearms, granting you the following benefits:

    - You gain proficiency with firearms (see "Firearms" in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
    - You ignore the loading property of firearms.
    - Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.

    Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice your level when you gain this feat. Whenever you gain a level thereafter, your hit point maximum increases by an additional 2 hit points.

-   Rogue Features

    ---

    Expertise
    
    At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
    
    At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.
    
    Sneak Attack: 2d6
    
    Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
    
    You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
    
    The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.
    
    Thieves' Cant
    
    During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
    
    In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.
    
    Cunning Action
    
    Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
    
    Roguish Archetype
    
    At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities from the list of available archetypes. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
    
-   Swashbuckler Features

    ---
    
    You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While some warriors are brutes clad in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks almost like a performance. Duelists and pirates typically belong to this archetype.
    
    A Swashbuckler excels in single combat, and can fight with two weapons while safely darting away from an opponent.
    
    Fancy Footwork
    
    When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.
    
    Rakish Audacity
    
    Starting at 3rd level, your confidence propels you into battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier.
    
    You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

-   Fighter Features

    ---

    Fighting Style
    You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.
    
    Archery
    You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

    Second Wind
    You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.
    
    Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
    
    Action Surge
    Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.
    
    Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.
    
    Extra Attack
    Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
    
    The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.
    
-   Renegade Features

    Scoundrel’s Wit
    
    Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the two of the following skills: Deception, Persuasion, or Sleight of Hand.
    
    Gunfighter Form
    
    Additionally, when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you begin constructing a custom firearm that suits your unique brand of renegade style. This process begins by selecting the form upon which to base your weapon. Choose one of the following options; each form grants you a new ability and unlocks certain upgrades you can add to your weapon at higher levels.
    
    Pistoleer
    
    Favoring speed and style over raw power, a renegade who adopts the Pistoleer form wields a small flintlock handgun. As an action on your turn, you can target a creature within 30 feet and shoot. Make a ranged attack roll against the target. You are proficient with the attack, and on a hit, the attack deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Dexterity modifier.
    
    The number of shots you can fire during a single action increases when you reach higher levels in this subclass: two shots at 5th level, three shots at 11th level, and four shots at 20th level. The shots can target the same creature or different creatures. Make a separate attack roll for each shot.
    
    Sniper
    
    Armed with a large two-handed firearm, a renegade who adopts the Sniper form can inflict massive damage in a single shot. As an action on your turn, you can target a creature within 120 feet and shoot. Make a ranged attack roll against the target. You are proficient with the attack, and on a hit, the attack deals piercing damage equal to 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier.
    
    You deal extra damage while using this form when you reach higher levels, dealing damage equal to 2d10 + your Dexterity modifier at 5th level, 4d10 at 11th level, and 6d10 at 20th level.
    
    Weapon of Choice
    
    Through a combination of salvaging stolen pieces of arcane technology and sheer rakish ingenuity, you can customize your firearm with various upgrades. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, pick one minor upgrade and one major upgrade from the Firearm Upgrades list at the end of this subclass. If an upgrade has a prerequisite, you must meet that prerequisite in order to benefit from the upgrade.
    
    You gain one additional minor upgrade at 5th level, and one additional major upgrade at 10th level.
    
    Cunning Shot
    
    Starting at 7th level, you learn to exploit a foe’s weak spots, even if they appear to have none. The damage dealt by your firearm, including damage dealt via Firearm Upgrades, ignores resistances and immunities.

-   Firearm Upgrades

    ---

    Firearm Upgrades
    
    Renegades alter their weapons to suit their personal knavish swagger. The following list provides various options to enhance your firearm’s capabilities. These upgrades may be personal touches you put on your weapon, or scavenged bits of Hextech that you’ve discovered and rigged to work with your weapon.
    
    Saving Throws:
    
    Some of these upgrades require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the effect. The saving
    throw DC is calculated as follows: Firearm Upgrade save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
    
    Minor Firearm Upgrades
    
    Collateral Damage
    
    Prerequisite: Sniper Form
    
    You alter your ammunition to have explosive capabilities. When you hit a target with a successful attack from your firearm, all creatures within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage.
    
    Crosshairs
    
    Prerequisite: 5th level
    
    You equip your firearm with a targeting mechanism. If you haven't moved this turn, you can aim down your sights as a bonus action, reducing your speed to 0 and granting you advantage on all attacks you make using your Gunfighter's Form feature until the end of your turn.
    
    Major Firearm Upgrades
    
    Double Up
    
    When you hit a creature with a successful ranged weapon attack with a firearm, you can immediately cause the bullet to hit another creature within 15 feet of the original target. The second target takes piercing damage equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of one). You can redirect a bullet in this way a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.
