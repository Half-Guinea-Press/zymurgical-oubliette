# References

I have a habit of going down rabbit holes when I research. So while I will try to limit the things in this section to relevent topics, I cannot guarantee that it will all obviously pertain to ttrpgs, worldbuilding, storybuilding, game design, game mechanics, etc. But I will do my best to provide citations for the things I reference and use. 

There is a page for my citations that will contain all of them in APA format. There will be a subsection in this section for anything that I have extracted from the original source whole clothe for use, the research subsection. And there is a list of links that I have found for things that I find interesting that I may or may not use. If I do then they will be moved to the citation page and possibly the research page depending on how I am using it.
