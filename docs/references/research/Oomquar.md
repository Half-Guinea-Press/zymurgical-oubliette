# Oomquar

Oomquar are ancient cephalopod humanoids from the deep who have lived an existence besmirched by aberrations and ancient evils. Friendly and playful, they often set out for adventure and to thwart evil. Amphibious, they make excellent seafolk and sailors.

## Strange and Alien

Big as humans and a mass of tentacles, oomquar are often undermined by their appearance. Appearing very much like huge upright cephalopods they are covered with glistening, rubbery skin and soft flesh that undulates and jiggles readily. The motions of this race are sinuous and unnaturally smooth and their six tentacle arms move in ways no bony limb could ever hope to. They stand on two larger tentacles that function as legs.

Oomquar are encountered in a number of colors ranging from rusty reds and browns to brighter colors. Rings, spots and rosette patterns are also common with stripes and more interesting patterns also occurring though with less frequency. These skin colors often change to reflect the mood of the oomquar, making it easy to determine the emotions of this race if one knows what to look for. This can make it difficult for oomquar to deceive people who have regular contact with them.

These strange humanoids have a beaked mouth hidden under the two tentacles sprouting from the front of their large head and large, dark eyes resting on the sides of their heads. These eyes allow them to see in front, back and to the sides without having to turn their heads.

## Creatures of Two Worlds

It would be easy to believe the oomquar are creatures at home only in the water but they are comfortable both on land and sea. Able to resist the crushing depths of the ocean they can also slip onto land, breathing both air and water with the same organs deep within their bulbous forms.

While they prefer to keep their bodies well hydrated, they suffer nothing more than intense discomfort as long as they are able to readily hydrate through drinking. Oomquar who are unable to moisten their skin for long periods of time become moody, short tempered and generally disagreeable. Exposing their skin to water or moisture returns them to their normal genial selves.

On land these creatures support their weight with two powerful tentacles that function very similar to legs though without articulated joints. These limbs slither and undulate to create a sort of rolling motion often supplemented by the oomquarâ€™s grasping tentacles.

## Strange Friends

To these deep dwelling octopods, friendship and kinship is everything. It often surprises other races when these tentacular folk are so willing to engage them as friends and equals. Oomquar form long lasting bonds they keep over incredible lifespans and in their own society each member is treated with value and respect. From the time they are laid in clusters of eggs in deep grottos to the time when they are committed to rest eternal in the deep, they are loved by their fellow oomquar and fostered in their endeavors.

Other races who make friends of oomquar are quick to learn of their prankster nature and often find themselves the butt of their jokes, though an oomquar is not generally the sort to engage in harmful pranks as such things often harm the bonds of friendship. Because their alien appearance often distances them from other races, oomquar intensely value the friendships they have with non-oomquar, often laying down their lives to save them or going well out of their ways to aid them.

## Much Maligned

A mysterious race of intelligent cephalopods, the oomquar have existed in the deep longer than nearly any other intelligent species. Often maligned for their appearance, these folk are gregarious among themselves and friendly to those strangers they encounter. Often slandered as somehow having connections to other horrible, tentacular beasts of the deep. Names like Krakes and Morks are often attached to them, insinuating they are minions or spawn of evil krakens and morkoths. Such associations are completely erroneous and the oomquar have long battled the insidious manipulations of these horrible denizens of the deep. Oomquar are often confused for aberrations and other forms of sea monsters.

Your DM might allow other simple tasks to be added to that list of options.
