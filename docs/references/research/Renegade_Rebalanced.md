# Martial Archetype: Renegade (Rebalanced)

What defines a Renegade is not simply the weapon they wield, or the ways they fight. A renegade, above all else, is a fighter of sly charm and swagger. With brash cockiness in spades, renegades build their own custom firearms to perfectly suit their own larger-than-life personalities. Particularly well-funded renegades may even have personalized Hextech weapons, but such folk are rare among the scoundrels of Bilgewater.

Don’t mistake their boasting for an empty facade-folk who underestimate a renegade’s flashy gunplay tend to wind up dead.

## Scoundrel’s Wit

Starting at 3rd level, your audacity only matches your wit, as a result, whenever you make a Charisma check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

In addition you gain proficiency with the one of the following skills: Deception, Persuasion, or Sleight of Hand.

Design note: Since the subclass features and firearm upgrades seem to orient the design towards intelligence, this ability should as well.

## Gunfighter Form

Additionally, when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you begin constructing a custom firearm that suits your unique brand of renegade style. This process begins by selecting the form upon which to base your weapon. Each form grants you a new ability and unlocks certain upgrades you can add to your weapon at higher levels. Choose one of the following options:

### Pistoleer

Favoring speed and style over raw power, a renegade who adopts the Pistoleer form wields a small flintlock handgun. As an action on your turn, you can target a creature within 30 feet and shoot. Make a ranged attack roll against the target. You are proficient with the attack, and on a hit, the attack deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Dexterity modifier. The number of shots you can fire during a single action increases when you reach higher levels in this subclass: two shots at 5th level, three shots at 11th level, and four shots at 20th level. The shots can target the same creature or different creatures. Make a separate attack roll for each shot.

### Sniper

Armed with a large two-handed firearm, a renegade who adopts the Sniper form can inflict massive damage in a single shot. As an action on your turn, you can target a creature within 120 feet and shoot. Make a ranged attack roll against the target. You are proficient with the attack, and on a hit, the attack deals piercing damage equal to 2d6 + your Dexterity modifier. You deal extra damage while using this form when you reach higher levels, dealing damage equal to 4d6 + your Dexterity modifier at 5th level, 7d6 at 11th level, and 10d6 at 20th level.

Design note: The damage of the sniper form was toned down to be in line with the rest of 5e. (You add the Dex mod to damage only once, which is why you get more damage dice than normal).

## Weapon of Choice

Through a combination of salvaging stolen pieces of arcane technology and sheer rakish ingenuity, you can customize your firearm with various upgrades. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, pick one minor upgrade and one major upgrade from the Firearm Upgrades list. If an upgrade has a prerequisite, you must meet that prerequisite in order to benefit from the upgrade.

You gain one additional minor upgrade at 5th and 15th level, and one additional major upgrade at 10th level. When you gain a level in this class you swap upgrades for upgrades of the same tier.

Design note: An additional minor upgrade and level swap to improve the versatility of the subclass.

## Cunning Shot

Starting at 7th level, you learn to exploit a foe’s weak spots, even if they appear to have none. The damage dealt by your firearm, including damage dealt via Firearm Upgrades, is considered magical for the purposes of resistances and immunities and ignores resistances.

Design note: No player ability in 5e ignores immunity, this shouldn't either. It's now magical.

## Grin and Bear It

At 10th level, you can brace yourself in the heat of battle, even when gravely wounded. When you use your Second Wind feature, your AC gains a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier, your movement speed increases by 20 feet, and you don't trigger attacks of opportunity until the start of your next turn.

Design note: This was too weak for a level 10 ability, now it's better.

## Right Gun for the Job

At 15th level, your skill with your firearm can adapt to any situation. When you finish a long rest, you can replace any of your Firearm Upgrades with a different one, though you cannot have more than two major upgrades equipped at a time. You must still meet the prerequisite of an upgrade in order to benefit from it.

In addition your handling of firearms is disturbing to the common folk, you gain proficiency in Intimidation. If you are already proficient, you can instead double your proficiency bonus for any ability checks made using Intimidation.

Design note: Added another proficiency to round up the feature, because by this time you're likely happy with your upgrades.

## Light ‘Em Up

At 18th level, you learn to channel the volatile force of your firearm’s black powder into a single concussive blast. As a bonus action, you can either throw or set down a small explosive. If thrown, the explosive has a range of 30 feet and detonates immediately on impact; if set down, the explosive can be detonated remotely from up to 60 feet away as another bonus action.

When detonated, each creature within a 15-foot radius of the explosive must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d6 force damage on a failure and half as much on a success. The DC for this saving throw is equal to your Firearm Upgrade DC.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

## Firearm Upgrades

Like many tinkerers who labor studiously in their workshops, renegades alter their weapons to suit their personal knavish swagger. The following list provides various options to enhance your firearm’s capabilities. These upgrades may be personal touches you put on your weapon, or scavenged bits of Hextech that you’ve discovered and rigged to work with your weapon.

### Saving Throws:

Some of these upgrades require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the effect. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Firearm Upgrade save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Design note: Everything about the flavor text screams intelligence, not innate power like charisma, so intelligence it is.

### Minor Firearm Upgrades

#### Blade and Black Powder

Prerequisite: Pistoleer Form

You create a matching blade to accompany your firearm, this blade has the statistics of a shortsword, rendering you a deadly opponent in both melee and ranged combat. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls. Additionally, when you use your action to shoot using your Gunfighter Form, you can use your bonus action to strike at a creature within melee range with that blade. You can also attack normally using this blade.

#### Caliber Net

By repurposing some salvaged Hextech parts, you equip your gun with an arcane net meant to trap opponents. As an action, choose a creature within range of your firearm. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Once you use this feature twice, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Collateral Damage

Prerequisite: Sniper Form

You alter your ammunition to have explosive capabilities. Once per turn, when you hit a target with a successful attack from your firearm, all creatures within 5 feet of the target must succeed a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 piercing damage. This damage increases to 5d6 when you reach level 11 in this class.

Design note: The damage here has been increased to be worthwhile, and the ability reduced to once per turn to save the GM time rolling saving throws.

#### Crosshairs

Prerequisite: 5th level

You equip your firearm with a targeting mechanism. If you haven't moved this turn, you can aim down your sights as a bonus action, reducing your speed to 0 and granting you advantage on your next attack you make using your Gunfighter's Form feature until the end of your turn.

Design note: Unlike Rogue cunning action: aim from UA, rogues only get 1 attack, fighters get 4, and chances are you'll be at range not moving anyway, and fighters don't have much BA use, so this has been nerfed to be more reasonable.

#### Double-Barrel

Prerequisite: Sniper Form, 5th level

You add a second barrel to your firearm. When you use your Gunfighter Form to fire, you can use your bonus action to fire again. You have disadvantage on this second attack roll.

Design note: That ability was insane, now it doesn't combo with crosshairs and it has some amount of drawback with the disadvantage on the second roll.

#### Smoke Screen

As an action, you alter the firing mechanism of your gun to release a burst of ash and smoke. This cloud forms a 10-foot cube centered on a point of your choice within the firearm’s range, spreading around corners, and the area covered by this cube is considered heavily obscured. This smoke lasts for 10 minutes and cannot be dispersed. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Major Firearm Upgrades

#### Barrage

As an action, you can fire a barrage of bullets. Each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from yourself must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking piercing damage equal to 3d10 + your Dexterity modifier on a failure and half as much on a success. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Double Up

When you hit a creature with a successful ranged weapon attack with a firearm, you can immediately cause the bullet to hit another creature within 15 feet of the original target. The second target takes piercing damage equal to twice your Dexterity modifier (minimum of two). You can redirect a bullet in this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.

Design note: Damage increase to match Trial by Fire.

#### Lightning Round

You equip your firearm with a volatile piece of stolen Hextech, allowing you to release a piercing bolt of electricity as an action on your turn. The lightning fires from you in a straight line that is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 lightning damage on a failure and half as much on a success. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest. This damage increases to 7d8 at level 11.

Design note: Same here, damage increase to compete with Trial by Fire.

#### Trial by Fire

As a bonus action, you can charge your weapons with blazing force. Until the start of your next turn, whenever you make a successful attack, you deal extra fire damage equal to half your fighter level, rounded up. You can charge your weapons this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and regain all uses after a short or long rest.
