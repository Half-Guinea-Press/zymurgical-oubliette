But instead of fangs or claws, the only thing that approached him were some dustballs of a silk-like material. He looked up, searching for their caster, and it didn't take long for him to recognize a white, humanoid figure, sitting above his little camp on a tree branch. She was weaving some kind of silky cloth, while gazing at his campfire, and not minding anything else surrounding her. </p> InfoAerugo Traits <p>Descendents of Fey Spirits</p> <p>The Aerugo are a race of humanoid moth-like people, characterized mainly by the presence of a second smaller pair of arms, a layer of thin fur covering most of their body (usually either gray or white, but it can sometimes be brown or even dark blue) , a pair of moth wings and two antennas protruding from their forhead. </p> <p>It is said that this moth-folk was the product of the fantasy of a moony Archfey, who created them to populate the nights of the material plane, and dress them with silk-like ribbons that gleam under the light of the moon. According to some others, Aerugo where created by the power of an ancient magic, that trapped some fey spirits into the bodies of this moth-like people. Wheter it was meant as a curse, so that they would be unnaturally attracted by lights, or as a blessing, giving them elegance and a real gift for weaving (or neither of them) is unknown. </p> <p>Welcoming but \"Inhospitable\" Societies</p> <p>Aerugo tend to form small communities in forest, usually in mild or cold regions, composed almost only by their kin. This isn't because of some kind of shyness, nor because they don't respect other races: in fact, aerugo love company, and often travel to nearby settlements to exchange goods or gather rumors about the rest of the world. The main reason why humans and other races don't stop for long in aerugo villages is because of the many quirks of this people: the main ones being the fact that they are active almost only at night, and that it is forbidden to light torches or lanterns inside their villages. Also, many aerugo structures are built high amidst tree branches, which makes it quite challenging for many common folk to reach them. </p> <p>Aerugo settlements often elect a king or queen as their leader, but many times it is paired with or substituted by a council of elders. </p> <p>An aerugo settlement will never grow to a great size, nor will it be centuries old, as these moth-folk love to travel and see new sights. Also, being their villages entirely built from wood, leaves and their own silk, they aren't able to withstand the test of time. </p> <p>Moth-like Lives</p> <p>Aerugo are born as larvae, but unlike butterflies they do not wander around as caterpillars before metamorphing into their adult form: they instead dig a hole into the ground, where they will make a cocoon and then turn into young aerugo, already capable of walking and flying. There is usually a common \"cocoon ground\" in each aerugo settlement, where parents leave their young larvae, waiting for them to turn into an adult moth. There is usually a short ceremony that precedes this. </p> <p>Because of this tradition, aerugo aren't able to recognize their own children, and young moths are usually brought up either by a small group of adult aerugo (which becomes their family) or by the whole settlement itself (making at times little difference, as aerugo settlements are quite small). In either case, an aerugo usually feels a way stronger tie with his community as a whole than to his \"family\" itself, and will often try to keep connected with it, using various kinds of messangers, ranging from travelers to butterflies. </p> <p>Skilled Weavers of Silvery Ribbons</p> <p>Aerugo are able to produce a silky, silvery substance thanks to some glands inside their mouths, which they then weave with great skill and expertise. Aerugo silk, which is both soft and strong, is highly valued among other races, and can fetch a high price at the right merchant. </p> <p>Although this silk would naturally have a wonderful silvery colour, it is possible to dye it. If submerged in dye right after it has been produced, it will quickly absorb the colour and keep it almost forever, taking many decades to fade. </p> <p>Night Wanderers, Seekers of Grace</p> <p>Even if they do form stable settlements, an aerugo will rarely live his whole life only within its borders: driven by an inexplicable curiosity, and particulartly by a desire to search for beauty, it will wander in the night, guided by the pale and reassuring light of the moon. </p> <p>When searching for something beautiful, an aerugo will rarely head thowards human towns or cities. Rather than for artificial forms of art, it will look for the ones that are within nature, such as in a great waterfall or a colorful aurora. It does occasionally happen though that an aerugo might prefer a statue to a dawn. In that case, he will travel from one city to another, often following a caravan of merchants or travelers, as this moth-folk appreciate the company of others, and will start thinking of them as part of their \"family\" if they earn their trust and friendship. </p> <p>Young aerugo are the ones that are easier to find wandering the nights, as with old age they'll settle in a village with others of their kin, or more rarely in human cities. This does not mean that they'll stop travelling: an old aerugo will still head out from time to time, in search of a beautiful sight, and come back home a few days later. </p> <p>Aerugo personality</p> <p>Even if aerugo can adapt to human society, they will never lose some of the characteristics they share with moths, resulting in them often standing out from the common crowd because of this (as if a pair of wings and four arms weren't enough) . </p> <p>You can use the aerugo Quirks table to determine a personality quirk for an aerugo character or to inspire a unique mannerism. </p> <p>Aerugo Quirks </p> d8 Quirk 1 You hate all kinds of artificial light, the only one you appreciate being that of the sun, the moon or the stars. 2 Artificial lights charm you as much as the ones of the moon or the stars. You can often be found staring at a torch or a lantern, bewitched. 3 Common sleep schedules aren't your thing: you always try to convince your companions to sleep during the day and travel at night. 4 You always leave a thin silky string wherever you go. 5 When nervous you start fiddling with your antennae. 6 You're easily angered when you see someone mistreating any kind of insect. 7 When talking, expecially when using Mothspeech, your second pair of arms expressively gestures on its own. Some of those gestures may be incomprehensible to other people than you though. 8 You carry some butterflies or other insects with you, and sometimes chat with them. Other people usually don't notice this, and think you are talking to yourself. <p>Aerugo Names</p> <p>Aerugo are given a name by the community they live in, resulting usually in a name in Mothspeech and one in Common, which is used by all other races when referring to them. Those names are usually one or two syllables long, with a prevalence of vowels and usually no harsh consonants. There is no distinction between male and female names. </p> <p>Aerugo names: Ausi, Dei, Eli, Fee, Inuue, Laenne, Leesha, Nae, Ofee, Ool, Phii, Pula, Sesi, Siio, Uumon, Wetha </p> <p>Your aerugo character has a variety of natural abilities, but who cares you'll never read these two lines. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Ability score increase</p> <p>Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1. </p> </li> <li> <p>Age</p> <p>Aerugo larvae mature into moths after around ten months, at which point they show the physical and mental age of a three-years-old human child. They mature at age 15, and are known to live up to 90 years. </p> </li> <li> <p>Alignment</p> <p>Aerugo tend towards chaotic alignments, as they grow with little amount of rules to bind them and, experiencing various cultures through their travels, they create their own set of moral laws. </p> <p>They almost never fall into evil alignments, as they respect other cultures and treasure the company of other people and the beauty of the world. </p> </li> <li> <p>Size</p> <p>Aerugo range in height from barely 4 feet to more than 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium. </p> </li> <li> <p>Speed</p> <p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet. </p> </li> <li> <p>Moth wings</p> <p>Your moth wings grant you a flying speed of 20 feet. To be able to use this speed, you mustn't be wearing heavy or medium armour. </p> </li> <li> <p>Darkvision</p> <p>Accustomed at having the moon as the only light in your days, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p> </li> <li> <p>Sensible antennae</p> <p>Thanks to your long antennae you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. </p> </li> <li> <p>Light susceptibility</p> <p>You are not accustomed to strong artificial lights, which distract you and impede you from focusing on your targets. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks when you are within 20 feet of a source of bright light that you can see, unless the object that spreads bright light is your target itself. </p> </li> <li> <p>Extra limbs</p> <p>You have a second pair of arms, which are smaller and weaker than your normal arms, but that can still carry out tasks with precision. Those arms can't wield weapons or shields, nor perform somatic components of spells, but can hold and use a spellcasting focus or any other small object, weighting up to 3 times your Strenght score. As a bonus action on your turn, you can use your extra limbs to interact with one additional object or feature of the Environment during either your movement or action (as described in page 190 in the PHB). </p> </li> <li> <p>Weaver of silk</p> <p>You gain proficiency with the Weaver's tools. Also, you can use you action to produce up to 5 feet of a thin, silky thread. In order to do that, your mouth and two of your hands must be free (you can use your secondary arms for this action) . The amount of silk you can produce is a number of feet equal to 5 times your Constitution score. Once you have produced the maximum length of silk, you can't produce any more until you finish a long rest.. The thread produced in this way is thin and breaks easily, but you can use some weaver's tool to make cloth out of it, which is instead warm, comfortable and resistant. </p> </li> <li> <p>Languages</p> <p>You can speak, read and write Common and Mothspeech. </p> </li> <li> <p>Mothspeech</p> <p>Mothspeech is mainly a language of transmitted pherormones, with few body language, and because of this it can't be written. Also, it is impossible for other creatures besides moths, butterflies or aerugo to comprehend this language (although it is possible with magic), and many won't even notice when you use it. </p> <p>Using Mothspeech, you can communicate simple ideas to moths and butterflies, and understand their \"speach\". Because of the limited vocabulary of this language, most aerugo speak through both Mothspeech and Common. </p> </li> <li> <p>Weaving the silk</p> <p>Here you can find a table describing how much thread you need in order to be able to weave various objects </p> Feet of Thread Object 250 Clothes, common 250 Clothes, travel 280 Clothes, fine 180 Blanket, 5 feet by 5 feet 20 Pouch 200 Rope, silk (50 feet) </li> </ul>"},{"location":"game_mechanics/species/bejuk/","title":"Bejuk","text":"<p>The sights (and scents) of bejuk caravans are not easilyignored.

The gremlins struggle to establish themselves in the world.</p> <p>These small creatures are no strangers to war and strife. Despite the natural dangers posed by their original homelands, neighboring factions sort to claim their unique resources. Many assumed the gremlins would be wiped out in a few years, but their size and ingenuity proved the world wrong.</p> <p>When nation fought nation on their scarred home, they would stay out of sight, surviving by making a habit of pil-fering the many battlefields for material and tools. But the wars would not last. In the end the violence culminated ina cataclysmic event that fully destroyed the gremlins home and forced them to flee - they have been nomads ever since, spread thin across the world.</p> <p>Because of their history, gremlins keep themselves distant from other races. Many might find a gremlin to be distrustful and stand offish, never settling down in other places for long. Despite this the gremlins share a collective dream of one day having a home that they can call their own once more.</p> InfoTraitsSpecies Feats <p>Invention from necessity</p> <p>Because of their past of war and scavenging, many a gremlins ancestor was exposed to tools they were never meant to use, and grew into a habit of cobbling things not meant to fit together. A talent born from survival for combing and rearranging unlikely material into working tools and inventions. This history of improvisation quickly became a part of gremlin culture.</p> <p>These skills have been passed down and finely honed to an almost innate ability. For a gremlin makes due with the most humble of scraps to great effect. As such, salvaging what other people have deemed unusable has become a great strength, which gained them the unfortunate infamy of being seen as trash diggers and scroungers. Gremlins are often found in derelict sites or trash heaps filled with free material for them to work with.</p> <p>A nose for magic</p> <p>The ancient ancestors of the gremlins, distant cousins of the goblins, were curious beings but dull of the mind, barely above common fauna. However, the unique resources of their homelands were magically infused minerals occasionally revealed by the soil and tucked away in crevices. The proto gremlins sometimes came upon these \u2018shiny rocks\u2019and would attempt to consume them. This diet became oddily beneficial to the humble gremlin, and kick started an evolutionary change. They developed magic senses in their nose and taste buds, allowing them to reliably find more precious minerals. This ability to sense magic also helped them avoid magical threats that were innate to their homelands. Over time, the ancient gremlins evolved into the smart and innovative creatures they are today.</p> <p>Gremlins have never been strangers to the chaos but there are some of them that actively seek it. This can vary from harmless mischief to outright sabotage. Though their actions do not help their poor reputation, gremlins find their actions more thrill and fun seeking then bad, looking to relieve stress and enjoy the world in their own chaotic way. This does not mean their actions are always in jest however, as they are also more likely to seek retribution to those who wrong them, or remind them of the forces that ruined their homelands. Be it for good or evil, anarchy reigns.</p> <p>Personality</p> <p>The gremlins are not known to be very friendly with other races. Distrusting, standoffish, socially inept, if they are not traveling in groups with other gremlins, they stick to themselves as hermits. Even if several gremlins occupy the same community, they will often compete with each other for resources.</p> <p>It is hard to gain trust, but once the trust is formed with a gremlin it is an unbreakable lifelong bond. While they are not emotionally intelligent, their bonds are deep and genuine. But do not expect them to be vocally sentimental, actions mean more than words.</p> <p>Physiology</p> <p>The gremlin shares ancestry with the common goblin. But with the exception of their diminutive size and large ears, they have little in common. Gremlins are covered in short-thin fur, commonly blue-adjacent with green or purple hues in the spectrum. They have a prehensile thin long thin tail with a fur-tip, and large almost cat-like eyes.</p> <p>Gremlin names</p> <p>Gremlin names are short and snappy to keep them efficient.

The history books say that wars are won with power over the world itself more than swords. The first great kingdoms and empires first grew with the support of their deities whose favor they had garnered. Only to fall as those same gods in their fickleness chose others as their champions. This continued in a cruel cycle that turned the world over and over. Until, the races realized that the divine where only children playing with them as toys. And the god's powers were something that they could wrest from the divine to hold themselves. And the control of the world changed hands to those who learned and mastered the ways of the arcane. Spells replaced prayers as the deciding factor on the battlefield. But just like the divine, the arcane was found to be fickle. Few had the ability to harness the power innately. And those who could learn to master them were even fewer. The time and study it took to bring destruction and subjecation to the battlefield was irreplaceable. Thus the loss of someone who had such power could bring the mightiest low. Recent history has shown that anyone can wield enough power to do just that.</p>"},{"location":"pregame/campaign_brief/#the-world-of-noksathr","title":"The World of Noksathr","text":""},{"location":"pregame/campaign_brief/#iliaster","title":"Iliaster:","text":"<p>While magic had always existed, the powers of gods were something that was seen as out of reach.

With enough the rules evaporated under the weight of augmented will.

Keeping their glow on in sight both over land but at sea meant you would always know where you were. But they were always near wild areas, no-man lands, ungoverned, unkempt, and full of nothing but death walking. An accident showed another purpose of their power.

Technology relied on the mistakes and discoveries of all that came before rather than the amassed skills and knowledge that single individuals gathered as wizards did. This enabled the common man to begin to find better ways to accomplish everyday tasks. At first, these technological leaps were suppressed by those with power in order to keep the power ballance steeply tipped in their favor. But as time ground forward, inovations became harder to hold back. Once those in power saw how much more money, influence, and power they could amass if they simply controled the masses and their technology, did they let loose the chains holding technology back. The subsequent explosion of advancement has become known as the industrial revolution. The modern world began to see things that only magic could provide before being accessible by the common man.

He became the general master of the army after the sucessful conquest and crushing of the Nira forced in the battle of Sacre Torc where his use of riflemen as anti-wizard units not only won the battle but irradicated the top war wizards of the Nira army. This promotion and acknowledgement of the ability of non-magical warfare spurned him futher. Through a series of wars he blazed a trail through the whole of the continent, creating an expansive empire that stretched futher than any in modern history. It was only due to internal political intrigue and betrayals that his reign ended. Beramendi exiled to an unnamed island, the empire only lasted a decade longer before the taken lands were won back by the defeated countries.

And with mixtures of magic and technology that separation can lead to explosive results. This makes most combinations found either in small scale one offs or large scale expensive projects. Alchemy is one of the only places where the arcane and science find a middle point.

That being said, the distribution of this diversity varies place to place. There are pockets of concentration for all species so while human is the majority species of the planet currently, any large enough population center will have any number of other species. That being said here are the general population thoughts on the common PHB Core Races:</p> <p>Human -  They are the common person. It all depends on their nationality, ethnicity, and wealth. Elf - A rare sight outside of the gentry and nobility. They are an old race from long ago and they carry knowledge of magics long lost. Many of the old houses have ties if not blood relations with the elves. Orc -  Crushed and scatter long ago due to wars and conflict. They are all refugees. Halfling/Gnome - Many believe them either fey or elven children. Tricksters and vagabonds. Dwarf -  Sealed up in their mountains. Shewd merchants and penny pinchers. Tieflings -  Unholy and cannot be trusted.  Shifters -  Wildmen that live on the edges of the scarred lands. More beast than man, the old magics must have twisted them.</p> <p>Other common races of this world:</p> <p>Aerugo -  Fragile like the moths they come from, these are even more rare than the elves. They tend to stay in their deep forests. They are mysterious and spiritual creatures that see more than the eyes should.</p> <p>Bejuk - Travelers and Wanderers, they rarely leave their herds. Great for when you need a caravan but pacifists all of them. They chew their cud like cows rather than raise swords.</p> <p>Gremlin - Mean spritied like things, you can find them where ever there is garbage or destruction. They can make anything out of the scraps of the greater species. But they don't trust anyone, and you can't trust them.</p> <p>Ogreborne -  Bastards from the demon wars of the east. No better than Tiefling with worse tempers. </p> <p>Verdan -  Twisted and freakish things that one would think are cousins to the Gremlins if anything. But no two are alike. Mutations from some science experiment gone wrong or some wizard's cruel joke.</p> <p>Stevedore -  Clockwork golems with their own thoughts. No one knows who made them, not even themselves. Started showing up in the ports a century ago. At first the ships thought the docks owned them and the docks thought the ships brought them. </p> <p>(I will be posting the Aerugo, Bejuk, Gremlin, Ogreborne, Verdan, and Stevedore soon.

The important difference in this world is where magic is within society. Pure arcane casters such as Bard, Sorceror, and Wizard are almost exclusively in the upper class. The nobility keep a strangle hold on who can learn magic in most countries. And those who don't outlaw magic use by non-royalty or gentry outright will instead conscript those who have magical ability into the military and make them magic-weilders for the crown. Artificers are slightly different as they tend to be from more scientific disciplines and thus are not seen as \"real\" wizards as their magic and magic related items only seem to work for them. Clerics are viewed as a mixture of clergy and wizards, their magic coming from a divine historical source without much of the direct religious beliefs more dogmatic rules.</p> <p>Classes that can be found in the Valda's Spire of Secret are also allowed without problems. The classes are typically viewed as such:</p> <p>Alchemist: Most science than Artificers, they are magical chemical engineers that use the arcane to further their understanding of the chemical and push that understanding to new limits.</p> <p>Captain: Natural leaders and orators, these people tend to be from military service or noble birth. They always have a follower or two in their footsteps. </p> <p>Craftsman: Craftsman push industry and technology from the front, making new and exciting advances everyday. </p> <p>Gunslinger: While firearms are common in conventional military forces, these are a different breed. Their understanding of projectile warfare and the tools of their trade make them unique threats on the battlefield.</p> <p>Investigator: The world is still full of mystery that hides in the shadows and cracks as everyone moves towards the future. These people hunt the secrets and bring light to the hidden.</p> <p>Martyr: Unfortunate champions of forgotten or unheard gods. They have a path that they did not choose and an end that will change the world whether they want to or not.</p> <p>Necromancer: Necromancy, the grim magic of death, is laden with forbidden secrets and unquestionably evil spells. Its practitioners, therefore, are a unique breed, possessing a well of dark energy to say nothing of their armies of undead thralls.</p> <p>Warden: Tanks of the battlefield. They can defend the line against overwhelming forces and soak damage while their compatriots rain hell down.</p> <p>Warmage -  More common than wizards, warmages focus on the simplest forms of magic turning what many consider nothing more than a party trick into devestating force on the battlefield. They are almost exclusively found in the military of their country.</p> <p>Witch -  They come from the darker recesses of the past. Afflicted by a sinister curse, witches can spin dark magic into hexes, which they use to debilitate foes. They are also accompanied by their familiars, loyal magical companions which they use to deal the killing blow.</p>"},{"location":"pregame/character_design_brief/#adventuring-equipment-technology-and-magic-items","title":"Adventuring Equipment, Technology, and Magic Items","text":""},{"location":"pregame/character_design_brief/#the-elephant-gun-in-the-room","title":"The Elephant Gun in the room","text":"<p>First and foremost, firearms exist in this world.
