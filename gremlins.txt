A once proud race that migrated from their dangerous
homelands, now wandering salvagers without a home of
their own. The gremlins struggle to establish themselves in
the world.
These small creatures are no strangers to war and
strife. Despite the natural dangers posed by their original
homelands, neighboring factions sort to claim their unique
resources. Many assumed the gremlins would be wiped
out in a few years, but their size and ingenuity proved the
world wrong.
When nation fought nation on their scarred home, they
would stay out of sight, surviving by making a habit of pil-
fering the many battlefields for material and tools. But the
wars would not last. In the end the violence culminated in
a cataclysmic event that fully destroyed the Gremlins home
and forced them to flee - they have been nomads ever since,
spread thin across the world.
Because of their history, Gremlins keep themselves
distant from other races. Many might find a gremlin to be
distrustful and stand offish, never settling down in other
places for long. Despite this the Gremlins share a collective
dream of one day having a home that they can call their
own once more.
I nventIon from necessIty
Because of their past of war and scavenging, many a
Gremlins ancestor was exposed to tools they were never
meant to use, and grew into a habit of cobbling things
not meant to fit together. A talent born from survival for
combing and rearranging unlikely material into working
tools and inventions. This history of improvisation quickly
became a part of Gremlin culture.
These skills have been passed down and finely honed to
an almost innate ability. For a Gremlin makes due with the
most humble of scraps to great effect. As such, salvaging
what other people have deemed unusable has become a
great strength, which gained them the unfortunate infamy
of being seen as trash diggers and scroungers. Gremlins are
often found in derelict sites or trash heaps filled with free
material for them to work with.
A nose for mAgIc
The ancient ancestors of the Gremlins, distant cousins of
the goblins, were curious beings but dull of the mind, bare-
ly above common fauna. However, the unique resources of
their homelands were magically infused minerals occasion-
ally revealed by the soil and tucked away in crevices. The
proto gremlins sometimes came upon these ‘shiny rocks’
and would attempt to consume them. This diet became
oddily beneficial to the humble gremlin, and kick started
an evolutionary change. They developed magic senses in
their nose and taste buds, allowing them to reliably find
more precious minerals. This ability to sense magic also
helped them avoid magical threats that were innate to their
homelands. Over time, the ancient gremlins evolved into
the smart and innovative creatures they are today.

Gremlins have never been strangers to the chaos but there
are some of them that actively seek it. This can vary from
harmless mischief to outright sabotage. Though their ac-
tions do not help their poor reputation, Gremlins find their
actions more thrill and fun seeking then bad, looking to
relieve stress and enjoy the world in their own chaotic way.
This does not mean their actions are always in jest howev-
er, as they are also more likely to seek retribution to those
who wrong them, or remind them of the forces that ruined
their homelands. Be it for good or evil, anarchy reigns.
P ersonAlIty
The Gremlins are not known to be very friendly with
other races. Distrusting, standoffish, socially inept, If they
are not traveling in groups with other Gremlins, they stick
to themselves as hermits. Even if several Gremlins occupy
the same community, they will often compete with each
other for resources.
It is hard to gain trust, but once the trust is formed with
a Gremlin it is an unbreakable lifelong bond. While they
are not emotionally intelligent, their bonds are deep and
genuine. But do not expect them to be vocally sentimental,
actions mean more than words.
P hysIology
The gremlin shares ancestry with the common goblin.
But with the exception of their diminutive size and large
ears, they have little in common. Gremlins are covered in
short-thin fur, commonly blue-adjacent with green or pur-
ple hues in the spectrum.They have a prehensile thin long
thin tail with a fur-tip, and large almost cat-like eyes.
gremlIn nAmes
Gremlin names are short and snappy to keep them effi-
cient. No one has time for a multi-syllable name. They also
like using names based on tools or simple onomatopeyas.
Last names are not common as gremlins usually travel in
small groups. But they might further identify themselves by
group, which they commonly call ‘crews’.

Asch, Brix, Calli, Dyna, Effy, Fuse, Geema, Harpyr,
Impa, Joell, Kindle, Lokke, Monkee, Nails, Ovah, Ply, Que,

gremlIn trAIts
As a gremlin you possess innate abilities that helped your
ancestors flourish and ensured your continued survival after the
destruction of your homelands.
Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score and Intelligence
scores each increase by 1.
Age. Gremlins reach adulthood around age 8. They rarely live
to past 60 due to external circumstances, but naturally they can
live longer than 200 years.
Alignment. Gremlins are inclined to lean towards chaotic
alignments, due to their nomadic nature and their discordant
penchant.
Size. Gremlins grow up to 3 feet tall. Your size is small.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Goblin,
and one additional language of your choice. It is not uncommon
for Gremlins pick up different languages as they travel.
Gadgeteer. You gain proficiency with a tool of your choice.
Magic Sense. You are aware if a magic item, or a magical
effect is within 30 ft. of yourself by smell and you can determine
if an item is magical by smell and taste. You can spend 10 minutes
interacting and handling an unidentified magic item and learn its
properties, how to use it, and if it requires attunement.
Inventive Mind. You can spend 1 minute of uninterrupted
work to create an improvised artisan tool that is not alchemist’s
supplies, or set of thieve’s tools. To do so, you must have access to
material, such as scrap metal and bones. The tool holds together
for one hour or until used, after which the tool will break and
becomes unusable.
Survival Philiosophy. Different schools of mind on how
to make it are found among Gremlins across the world. Each of
these philosophies discribe how you as a Gremlin carve out a path
for yourself in this world. Choose one of the following; Ingenuity,
and Trickery.
IngenuIty
You prefer to use your intelligence for problem solving, being
convinced that the right idea is the key to any issue. Occasionally
you show unrivaled moments of inventiveness and critical think-
ing capabilities thanks to your finely honed mind.
Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by
1.
Booksmart. You are proficient in one of the following skills:
Arcana, History, Investigation.
Moment of Ingenuity. When push comes to shove your
mind works overtime to find a solution for your current predica-
ment. When you fail an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw,
you can add your proficiency bonus to the result, which may cause
the roll to become a success. Once you use this feature, you can’t
use it again until you have finished a short or long rest.
Brilliant Utilisation. When using a tool you can make an
Intelligence check in place of another ability score for any task.
Check out these other Player Races!
Aside from the Hagspawn I also have
created 2 other player races: the Gnolls,
true daredevils, survivors, and inhabitors of
the unwated earth, and the Hagspawn, the
discarded children of hags who will have to
rise above in spite of what the world thinks
of them.

ciency modifier to any check to escape a grapple or
restraint.
