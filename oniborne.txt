Oniborne

On an exterior wall, above a dingy tavern door,rotten from rain and time, a sign was plastered:

“NO ONI”

I hesitated, turning to Yaboku, who met my eyeswith a smile.“I’m not allowed through this door,” he chuckled,“But I can make my own.” His hand curled into afist and, with a single blow, the tavern wall burstopen, the sign falling to the mud at his feet.— Ryoko’s Diary
